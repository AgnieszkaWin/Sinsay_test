The last test is not finished.

I had some technical problems so I resorted to doing it as fast as possible the way I already know how so I did not include yesterday's instructions, since I didn't have time to look at my notes.

I will continue to work on this project as a personal practice and try to implement instructions from yesterday when I have the time.

Have a good day!
